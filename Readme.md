Tax Slider
==========
A different way to see how the government takes your money (I hear they do some stuff in return for
it--seems fair).

Updated for 2018, also added a feature to show what taxes would have been if there was no new tax
law passed.


Instructions
-----------
Move the slider, enjoy yourself, no particular order.
